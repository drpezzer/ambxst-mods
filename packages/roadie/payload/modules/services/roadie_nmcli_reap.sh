# Ambxst Roadie: end the `nmcli monitor` processes Ambxst's daemon leaves
# behind.
#
# The daemon starts one `nmcli monitor` per network subscriber and reads its
# output through a pipe. A reload restarts the daemon, which does not take
# that child with it: the monitor is handed to init, its pipe has no reader
# left, and because the daemon runs with SIGPIPE ignored (and the child
# inherits that) writing into the dead pipe does not end it either. One more
# stays behind per reload, until logout.
#
# Ended here are only processes that are all of:
#   - this user's, with the command line exactly `nmcli monitor`;
#   - handed to init / the user's systemd (their parent is gone);
#   - writing to a pipe no other process has open.
# A monitor someone else started and still reads -- a bar script, a terminal
# -- has a live parent or a reader, and is left alone. `--dry-run` only lists.
#
# Prints one line per process ended: `reaped <pid>`.
