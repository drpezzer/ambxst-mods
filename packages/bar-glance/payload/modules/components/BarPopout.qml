// BarPopout: the two forms a bar widget's popout can take, behind one handle.
//
// With "contain bar" off the bar is a row of floating pills, so a popout is a
// pill too — a BarPopup window offset from the bar, exactly as before.
//
// With it on the bar is part of the frame, and a window floating next to it
// reads as a separate object stuck to a solid band. Attached, the popout is
// instead drawn inside UnifiedShellPanel's own surface (see BarFlyout), where it
// shares the frame's fill and flares back into it with concave corners — the
// frame bulging out around the button rather than something sitting on top of
// it. That surface belongs to the shell panel, not to the bar widget, so the
// contents are handed over as a Component and instantiated there.
//
// Either way the widget declares its contents once, as a child of this:
//
//     BarPopout {
//         id: thingPopout
//         anchorItem: buttonBg
//         bar: root.bar
//         popupPadding: 16
//
//         Item {
//             implicitWidth: 220
//             implicitHeight: 132
//             ...
//         }
//     }
//
// The contents must declare their own implicitWidth/implicitHeight — that is
// what both hosts size themselves from — and are laid out at exactly that size.
